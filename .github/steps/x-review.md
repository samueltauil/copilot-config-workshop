Here is a recap of your accomplishments:

- Applied six prompt engineering strategies to get better responses from Copilot
- Generated unit tests with Copilot, saved them, and ran them to verify correctness
- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to give Copilot persistent project context
- Verified that Copilot loads custom instructions by checking the **Used n references** panel
- Created path-specific instruction files in `.github/instructions/` targeting Python files
- Used chat participants (`@workspace`, `@github`), slash commands (`/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`), and chat variables (`#file`, `#selection`, `#codebase`)
- Created reusable prompt files (`.prompt.md`) for repeatable multi-step workflows
- Created custom agents (`.agent.md`) with specialized behavior and tool restrictions
- Used the test-specialist agent to generate, run, and iterate on test suites
- Learned best practices for managing Copilot configuration at the organization level
