Here is a recap of your accomplishments:

- Applied six prompt engineering strategies to get better responses from Copilot
- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to give Copilot persistent project context
- Created path-specific instruction files in `.github/instructions/` to target specific file types
- Used chat participants (`@workspace`, `@github`), slash commands (`/explain`, `/fix`, `/tests`), and chat variables (`#file`, `#selection`, `#codebase`) to interact with Copilot Chat
- Created reusable prompt files (`.prompt.md`) to turn multi-step workflows into one-click actions
- Created custom agent modes (`.agent.md`) with specialized behavior and response formats
- Created custom agents for testing, planning, and debugging with YAML frontmatter and structured prompts
- Used custom agents in VS Code and learned how to use them with the Copilot coding agent on GitHub.com
- Learned best practices for managing Copilot configuration files at the organization level
