Here is a recap of your accomplishments:

- Applied prompt engineering strategies and explored five Copilot interaction modes
- Built a **Planner Agent** that generates structured project plans
- Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to standardize project conventions
- Built an **Architect Agent** that reads plans and produces data schemas
- Created path-specific instruction files for models, services, and utilities
- Built a **Developer Agent** that turns schemas into working implementation code
- Created reusable prompt files (`.prompt.md`) for test generation workflows
- Built a **Tester Agent** that generates, runs, and iterates on test suites
- Built an **Orchestrator Agent** that coordinates the full software development lifecycle
- Delivered a new feature end-to-end: plan, design, implement, test, and document
