# Workshop Custom Instructions

This repository is a GitHub Copilot configuration workshop. It contains no application code
to build, test, or deploy. The content consists entirely of Markdown documentation and
small starter code files used in exercises.

## Repository Structure

- `exercises/` - Workshop exercises, one subdirectory per exercise
- `.github/instructions/` - Path-specific Copilot instruction examples
- `slides/index.html` - Self-contained HTML slide deck
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent instruction file

## Writing Style

- Use US English.
- Write in present tense.
- Use active voice.
- Keep sentences under 25 words.
- Do not use em dashes.

## Markdown Conventions

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use fenced code blocks with a language identifier.
- Use ordered lists for sequential steps and unordered lists for non-sequential items.
- Use relative links for cross-references within the repository.

## Code Samples

- Code samples in exercise files must be complete and runnable.
- JavaScript samples target Node.js (no browser-specific APIs unless stated).
- Python samples target Python 3.10+.
- Do not add package dependencies to exercise starter files.
