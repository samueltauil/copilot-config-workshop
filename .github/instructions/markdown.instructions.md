# Markdown File Instructions

## Writing Style

- Use present tense for instructions and descriptions.
- Use active voice (e.g., "Run the command", not "The command should be run").
- Keep sentences under 25 words.
- Do not use em dashes. Use a comma, period, or rewrite the sentence instead.
- Avoid filler words: "simply", "just", "easily", "obviously".

## Structure

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`). Do not use underline-style headings.
- Use fenced code blocks (```) with a language identifier for every code sample.
- Use ordered lists (1., 2., 3.) for sequential steps.
- Use unordered lists (-) for non-sequential items.
- Leave a blank line before and after every heading, list, and code block.

## Links

- Use relative links for files within the repository.
- Write link text that describes the destination. Avoid "click here".

## Code Examples

- Every code example must be complete and executable.
- Include the expected output as a comment or a separate block.
