# GitHub Copilot Configuration Workshop

_Learn to configure and use GitHub Copilot effectively through hands-on exercises._

## Welcome

- **Who is this for**: Developers who want to get the most out of GitHub Copilot.
- **What you'll learn**: Prompt engineering, custom instructions, path-specific instructions, prompt files, custom agents, and agent orchestration across the software development lifecycle.
- **What you'll build**: Five specialized Copilot agents that plan, design, implement, test, and orchestrate a Task Manager application end-to-end.
- **Prerequisites**:
  - A GitHub account with access to GitHub Copilot
  - One of the following:
    - **GitHub Codespaces** (recommended, no local setup required)
    - Visual Studio Code with the GitHub Copilot extension installed
- **How long**: This workshop takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Practice prompt engineering strategies and build a **Planner Agent** (Planning phase)
1. Create repository-wide custom instructions and build an **Architect Agent** (Design phase)
1. Add path-specific instructions and build a **Developer Agent** (Implementation phase)
1. Create reusable prompt files and build a **Tester Agent** (Testing phase)
1. Build an **Orchestrator Agent** and deliver a new feature using the full SDLC pipeline

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it takes a bit longer.
- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
